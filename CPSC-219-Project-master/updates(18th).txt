-adding a copy constructor for room
-adding a getRoomList to floorplans, returns a copy list of copy rooms.
-added a copy constructor to Door
-added roomlist to finderapp for validRoom methods. 
	.now clears the error message when proper input is added.
-javadoc in finderApp updated
-now have temporary start and dest numbers and setters/getters for them (with javadoc!).

finderApp
-added 3 new buttons & added function
-updated some (not all) of the jvadoc
-path can move up ONE level (if we make it more than two floors will have to update this), label sets properly and so does map
-changed validStart & validDest so they actually uses the room class. Will likely rename them to startsOnSameFloor and endsOnSameFloor since their scope is the current floor plan.
