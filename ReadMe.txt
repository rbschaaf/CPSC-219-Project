ReadMe - Room Finder App

Thank you for taking the time to read this and view our final project for the semester. This program is a room finding app for the Taylor Family Digital Library and Biological Sciences buildings at the University of Calgary. It allows the user to find the path between two rooms in the same building. The user can find rooms between different floors as well.

The path finding utilizes logic following pseudo code from Dijkstra's algorithm.

The GUI app allows the user to pick a building from the drop down Combo box and type in a starting room and a destination room then pressing "Submit" to generate the path. The user also has the option of clicking a room number on the map and selecting if it is the start or destination room (pressing either "Store in start" or "Store in destination") and then doing the same for another room, before pressing "Submit" to generate the path.



Requirements:
Linux or Windows operating system. Java installed.



Installation:
1. Download the CPSC219Group05 zip file into a new folder.
2. Open the "main" folder in the Terminal (within folder "src").
3. Type javac *.java to compile the entire folder



Running the program:
1. Open the folder in the Terminal.
2. Type java FinderApp to run the GUI portion of the program
3. Type java MapMain to run the text-based version of the program.

To generate a path on the GUI version:
1. From the "Building:" drop down combo box pick the name of a building.
2. In the "Start Room:" text field type in a room number as an integer.
3. In the "Destination Room:" text field type in a different room number as an integer.
4. Click the "Submit" button to generate the path on the map.
        Optional: Change the size of the map generated by selecting from the radio buttons on the right side prior to clicking "Submit".
        Optional: Select a previously saved path from the "Saved Paths" drop down combo box on the right side.
5. If the room numbers are on different floors: The path will start on the starting room's floor and provide a default path to the elevator. To view the path on the destination room's floor press the red "Next Floor" button on the right side.
        Optional: To change your path to the stairs, instead of the elevator, press the orange "Stairs" button on the right side prior to pressing the red "Next Floor" button. Pressing the aqua-marine "Elevator" button will change it back to the elevator path.
6. After generation of the initial path, new paths between different rooms can be found following #1-4 again or by following #7-10 instructions for using the clickable map.
7. Click a desired room number on the map. It will become highlighted red.
8. At the top, select whether to "Store the selection in start room" or "Store the selection in destination room".
        -To unhighlight a room: click the highlighted room a second time to no longer have it selected.
9. Do the same for the other corresponding room and select to store the room number in the other text field.
10. Press the "Submit" button after making your selections.
11. Additional paths can be found by following combinations of #1-4 and #7-10.
Note: Longer paths may take longer to load, so if the path does not load immediately it needs a few more seconds (we have verified that all paths can be generated successfully).

Optional: To save a path on the GUI version:
1. Create a path you wish to save for future use. Note: You can only save paths that are made on a single floor. A message will inform you if the path you try to save is a 2-part path across two floors, and will subsequently not save.
2. Triple click in the "Save Path as:" text field to highlight the text.
3. Enter a name to save the path under.
Note: If the name is already in use, the name will have a number in brackets added to the end.
4. The saved path will now be saved and available immediately and for future use in the "Saved Paths" drop down combo box. All saved paths are saved in the "SavedPaths" folder (created upon application start).

To generate a path on the text-based version:
Note: you will be prompted for each value.
1. Enter the a number corresponding the the building name. (Either "Taylor Family Digital Library" or Bioscience")
2. Enter a destination room number and press "Enter".
3. Enter a starting room number and press "Enter".
4. The first map generated is the floorplan grid without a path.
5. The second map generated is your path . The starting room is denoted by a 8 and the destination room is denoted by an 5. The path is highlighted by 7's with the hallways being 1's and the walls being 0's. 1000 series numbers denote rooms and the number 1000 lower than the room numbers denotes the corresponding room's door (example room is 1151 and the door is 151).

Some good room combinations to use the app to start are:
1. For "Taylor Family Digital Library":
        Floor 0: Rooms 19 and 37.
        Floor 1: Rooms 151 and 153.
        Floor 2: Rooms 261 and 264.
        Floor 3: Rooms 353 and 359.
        Floor 4: Rooms 455 and 453.
        Floor 5: Rooms 553 and 547.
        Floor 6: Rooms 625 and 646.
2. For "Bioscience":
        Floor 1: Rooms 190 and 177.
        Floor 2: Rooms 213 and 295.

In the GUI, to see different floors try combinations using rooms on different floors like:
1. "Taylor Digital Family Library", Rooms 642 and 154.
2. "Taylor Digital Family Library", Rooms 259 and 553.


Unit Tests:
The JUnit tests are located in the test folder within the zip folder.



Highlights:
-Room numbers can be entered by using the keyboard or clicking room numbers on the map using the mouse.
-The start is highlighted in orange with an "S" denoting it.
-The destination is highlighted in yellow with a "D" denoting it and the destination room is highlighted in blue.
-The path is highlighted by footprint images.
-The user can save a path.
-Saved paths are stored automatically in a "SavedPaths" subdirectory that is automatically set up in the current directory.
-Any saved paths in the "SavedPaths" subdirectory are automatically populated into the "Saved Paths" drop down combo box taking into account if the operating system is Windows or Linux when the program is run.
-Paths are saved as a binary object.
-Three radio buttons to denote the size of the map that should be generated. For example, "Small Map" for smaller windows, "Medium Map" for fullscreen, and "Large Map" for on a large projector.
-Generated map is in a scrollpane and is also draggable to allow easier viewing of larger maps.
-"Help?" button pops up a window with instructions for the user on using the app.
'"About this App" button pops up a window with information on the app and creators.
-"Back" button takes the user back to the home screen.
-Messaging is provided to the user on what building and floor the they are viewing.
-Messaging is provided to the user if room numbers they are submitting are incorrect.
-If the user enters a starting room number that is on a different floor than the destination room number, colored buttons appear to give the option of choosing "Stairs" or "Elevator" (default is to Elevator). There is a "Next Floor" button the user clicks to generate the path on the destination floor.
-A functional text based version also exists.
